# Patrick Chouinard

AI Architect & Trainer helping organizations turn Generative AI into real business value. 30+ years across the Microsoft ecosystem (M365, Azure, Power Platform, SharePoint) with a practical, people-first approach to adoption.

## About me

- I design enterprise AI adoption strategies, hands-on training programs (beginner to expert), and proofâ€‘ofâ€‘concepts that deâ€‘risk implementation.
- I coach teams on prompt engineering, GitHub Copilot, and Microsoft Copilot for M365 to boost productivity responsibly and measurably.
- I build repeatable playbooks: prompt libraries, training curricula, governance guidance, and integration patterns aligned to business outcomes.
- I work holistically at the intersection of technology, process, and peopleâ€”driving change management and user adoption as much as architecture.
- Bilingual: English and French.
